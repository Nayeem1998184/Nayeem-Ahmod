# 📊 Nayeem Ahmod – Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data science and analytics portfolio! This repository showcases a range of machine learning, data analysis, and visualization projects I've completed using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and relevant libraries. Each project is designed to demonstrate my ability to clean data, build models, and generate insights that support decision-making.
